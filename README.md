# Enterprise-Grade Kubernetes Platform Architecture

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture for the Enterprise-Grade Kubernetes Platform. The platform includes the following key components:

- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Managed with AWS EKS.
- **GitOps with FluxCD**: For continuous deployment of applications and infrastructure.
- **Cilium and Hubble**: For advanced networking and observability.
- **Monitoring Stack**: Includes Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for metrics, dashboards, and log aggregation.
- **Security**: Implemented using RBAC, network policies, and OPA.

## Key Components

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster

Managed via AWS EKS, providing the foundation for running containerised applications.

### 2. GitOps with FluxCD

Automates the deployment and management of Kubernetes resources via Git.

### 3. Advanced Networking with Cilium

Provides security and observability through eBPF-based networking.

### 4. Monitoring Stack

Utilises Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards, and Loki for log aggregation.

### 5. Security

Includes RBAC, network policies, and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for enforcing security policies.
